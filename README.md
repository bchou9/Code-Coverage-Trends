# Code-Coverage-Trends

### Introduction
GitHub, as a hub of software collaboration and innovation, hosts countless repositories covering a wide array of projects. Understanding how the popularity of projects on GitHub correlates with their code quality is essential for advancing software development practices. In this study, we investigate this relationship by analyzing code coverage metrics within popular repositories over time. By uncovering patterns in code coverage progression, we aim to provide insights that can enhance testing practices, foster collaboration, and ultimately improve the quality of software delivered to users.
